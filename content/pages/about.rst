Questions about architecture definition and requirements analysis? 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An architecture framework and supporting tools can really help:

* `Enterprise Architecture Framework <http://www.architectureframework.com/>`_

And don't let the term *enterprise* put you off, as there are many levels of 
refinement and detail in something like the above (and pretty much anything 
more complex than a thimble can use at least a few architectural pieces 
documented).

One thing about requirements engineering/analysis, no matter what you call 
them (use cases, user stories, requirements specifications) you should take 
the time to derive some relevant (and testable) technical and/or performance 
requirements in addition to the user-focused parts.  Track and trace them to 
code and test cases, and you're half way home...

Questions about system security and information protection?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See the `DISA STIG documentaion and support tools <http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/>`_
(hint: they can be used to help assess and understand the risks of *any* 
system connected to the outside world).  One of the default security 
enhancements in the Linux kernel has been around for many years:

* `Security Enhanced Linux <http://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page>`_

Questions about open source software development, embedded Linux, or low cost embedded hardware?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are abundant resources for these topics (see the sidebar, including 
the VCT gihub repos) so it all depends on what kinds of project ideas you 
have percolating.  We design and build large and small systems based on 
GNU/Linux and other open source tools.  A few example starting points:

* `Gentoo x86 Handbook <http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml>`_ (available for multiple architectures)
* `Yocto Project Documentation <https://www.yoctoproject.org/documentation/current>`_
* `RaspberryPi.Org <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_

`Tell us <contact.html>`_ about your project, and we can probably help.
