VCT Labs offers technical services for computer system hardware and software
development.  Contracts have included embedded system development as well as
general computer system development, both for government work and in the
commercial arena.

VCT Labs specializes in the application of Open Source technology to real-world
problems.  The dedication of many staff members to open technology extends
beyond their professional duties to their personal time.  Our software
engineers go home and run Linux and other Open Source software on our personal
computers.  Several core members, including the president, of our local Linux User Group 
are members of VCT engineering staff.  VCT engineers participate as
members of Open Source projects.  Hardware-related personal projects 
include using FPGAs and arduinos for electrical monitoring of old (we like
to say "classic") cars from before the era of on-board computers, or
participating in the RepRap 3-D printing community.
