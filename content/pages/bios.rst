Stephanie Lockwood-Childs has over 10 years experience in Linux OS programming for desktop machines, servers, and embedded systems. She has strong experience in kernel drivers, having written drivers for a wide variety of devices such as a touchscreen, an analog-to-digital card, a high-speed digital I/O card, an SPI bus, an embedded SCSI disk controller, an embedded serial port, an eeprom, a PCI bridge chip, and various drivers for project-specific hardware implemented in FPGAs. Stephanie also develops Linux applications in C, Perl, Python, and Unix shell, including network applications, embedded applications, and CGI web applications. She is comfortable with a variety of Linux build tools and installation methods and enjoys troubleshooting Linux system and networking problems. She also is experienced in the area of Linux security, including security hardening for Linux-based network appliances and firewalls and DoD STIG compliance for Linux workstations and servers. Stephanie has a BA in physics from Westmont College, a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCSB, and a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering with an emphasis in Imaging Systems and minor in Computer Architecture, also from UCSB.

Ron Lockwood-Childs - Diagnostics/Linux Software/Firmware
---------------------------------------------------------

Ron Lockwood-Childs has 14 years of experience in embedded development, from FPGA firmware to boot loaders to diagnostics and Linux application development -- all stages of board bring-up and testing. He is proficient with VHDL simulation test benches, logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, JTAG testing tools, GDB, and other tools of the trade for debugging both hardware and software on embedded devices. He utilizes various hardware and software languages for low-level testing and analysis, such as VHDL, assembly, C, shell scripts, and Ruby. His experience spans the major 32-bit architectures: PowerPC, ARM, MIPS, XScale, and of course Intel. He has released as Open Source Software “ppcdiags”, a standalone diagnostics software package that runs without an OS on PowerPC embedded boards. At a higher level, he has worked on a team to develop Linux software, for example device drivers, CGI software, image capture, and printer support. Ron has a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCSB.

Stephen Arnold - Risk Assessment/Open Source Development Tools and Processes/Education and Training

Since graduate school, he has worked as a full-time engineer, part-time faculty/open source volunteer, and consultant on many projects, including software development, geophysical data acquisition/analysis, air toxics risk assessment, and training.  Starting in the early 90's, Mr. Arnold worked on IV&V (Independent Verification and Validation) of meteorological and range safety data systems at Vandenberg Air Force Base, as an IV&V analyst on the Range Safety Display System (RSDS), the Acquisition Data System (ADS), and other portions of the real-time range safety systems, as a range support engineer for the AF Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), and as software & test engineer on the RSA MARSS program.  He then worked as the Flight Operations and Weather lead on the System Performance Evaluation & Verification (SPEV) and Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) contracts for AF Space Command acquisition, followed by over 2 years of "DevOps", CI/QA, and test engineering on an embedded linux project.  In addition to the above, he has over 10 years experience as Assoc. Faculty in Geography, over 2 decades of open source and GNU/Linux experience (with over 10 years as a Gentoo Developer).  He has a BSc in Geophysics from San Diego State University, an MSc in Geophysics, also from SDSU, and has completed several post-graduate courses and workshops in topics such as air toxics, doppler weather radar, programming languages, and data structures/algorithms.

Donald Burr - System and Network Troubleshooting/Web Programming/Customer Support and Training
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
