Version 1.0.4

o Implemented general serial console support controlled by config defines
  SERIAL_SMC = {1,2} or SERIAL_SCC = {1,2,3,4} to handle console on
  SMC1, SMC2, SCC1, SCC2, SCC3, or SCC4 (tested with console on SMC1 and SCC1)

o Allow an upper limit of memory size to be supplied to memory calculation 
  code, instead of defaulting to the constant 512MB

o Fixed problem with timing loops when running without ppcboot

o Added NAND flash tests

o Added Red Box tests

Version 1.0.3

o Moved the gendiags.sh variables into the Makefile to make them easy to
  override if necessary.

Version 1.0.2

o Added instruction cache support.  The instruction cache is disabled at
  startup, and re-enabled at the end of power-up testing if it was enabled when
  the diagnostics started.  Its contents are not restored, so beware if any
  icache locking mechanism is in use before starting the diagnostics.  The
  instruction cache is also enabled by default during the memory tests.  To use
  it, #define ENABLE_ICACHE_SUPPORT in config.h.  #undef this constant, and the
  instruction cache won't be touched at all during the diagnostics (not even at
  the start & finish).

o Added #ifdef ENABLE_PPC_IDMA0_SUPPORT conditional around DMATest case in
  memory/mem_err.c: this file wouldn't compile if the constant wasn't defined.

o Added #ifdef ENABLE_GREEN_BOX_SUPPORT conditional around the run-time menu
  alterations section in display_main_menu(), since this section wouldn't
  compile if the constant wasn't defined.

o Added new "Quick Test" memory test which can test about .75 MB/s on the 50MHz
  MPC860T.  It flashes an LED instead of printing to the console; see config.h
  for setting up the quick memory test LED at compile time.

o Fixed the module.mak section dealing with assembly source files in a .list.
  The `make depend' process should now properly create .depend entries for
  assembly sources.

o The LED test, quick memory test, and burn-in testing should now pay attention
  to the settings in config.h.  Check config.h for the new LED constants -
  there should be a number beside both QUICK_MEM_LED and BURN_IN_OK_LED.  LED 0
  would be the 0th bit in the LED register.  If you don't care about LED
  functionality, set LED_BASE_ADDR to some untouched memory location.

o Fixed up pkt_stat() a bit, so it will print only 2 decimal places, but more
  accurately.

Version 1.0.1
