o Various small changes

o CPM I2C transmit capability added (not documented yet)

Version 1.1.0

Four major additions to this latest release, which should explain the long
silence since the last release..

o Added PLX 9054 support for accessing a PCI bus from the 86X processor.
  Current tests:
   - PCI device discovery (bus 0 only; i.e. no PCI -> PCI bridge support)
   - Read/write PCI registers on a given IDSEL
   - Read/set registers on the PLX 9054

o Added LSI 53C810A PCI SCSI adapter support.
  Current tests:
   - SCSI reset
   - Script test (runs simple SCSI script & verifies operation)
   - Inquiry test (For now, only on SCSI ID 2)
   - Request sense test (ID 2)
   - Read/write block (16-byte) commands to SCSI disk devices (again, only ID 2)
   - Test LSI53C810A PCI config regs, and internal regs.

o Added TI 1410A PCI Cardbus adapter support.
  Current tests:
   - Read/write TI 1410A Config registers
   - Read/write cardbus registers
   - Read/write EXCA (PCMCIA compatibility) registers
   - Test SRAM PCMCIA card attached to cardbus socket (our card lacks attribute
     memory, unfortunately, so there's no code to support that at this time).

o Wrote first cut of sysbus sniffer diagnostics.

o Fixed var args compile bug with 3.2 gcc.  Was using stdargs.h copied from a
  particular gcc, now using the system default.

o New make target "html" to create web pages in the html/ directory with
  hyperlinked syntax-highlighted source code.  Should only be run after the
  syntax has been verified.  Requires the source-highlight program to be
  installed on the build system.

Version 1.0.4

o Implemented general serial console support controlled by config defines
  SERIAL_SMC = {1,2} or SERIAL_SCC = {1,2,3,4} to handle console on
  SMC1, SMC2, SCC1, SCC2, SCC3, or SCC4 (tested with console on SMC1 and SCC1)

o Allow an upper limit of memory size to be supplied to memory calculation 
  code, instead of defaulting to the constant 512MB

o Fixed problem with timing loops when running without ppcboot

o Added NAND flash tests

o Added Red Box tests

Version 1.0.3

o Moved the gendiags.sh variables into the Makefile to make them easy to
  override if necessary.

Version 1.0.2

o Added instruction cache support.  The instruction cache is disabled at
  startup, and re-enabled at the end of power-up testing if it was enabled when
  the diagnostics started.  Its contents are not restored, so beware if any
  icache locking mechanism is in use before starting the diagnostics.  The
  instruction cache is also enabled by default during the memory tests.  To use
  it, #define ENABLE_ICACHE_SUPPORT in config.h.  #undef this constant, and the
  instruction cache won't be touched at all during the diagnostics (not even at
  the start & finish).

o Added #ifdef ENABLE_PPC_IDMA0_SUPPORT conditional around DMATest case in
  memory/mem_err.c: this file wouldn't compile if the constant wasn't defined.

o Added #ifdef ENABLE_GREEN_BOX_SUPPORT conditional around the run-time menu
  alterations section in display_main_menu(), since this section wouldn't
  compile if the constant wasn't defined.

o Added new "Quick Test" memory test which can test about .75 MB/s on the 50MHz
  MPC860T.  It flashes an LED instead of printing to the console; see config.h
  for setting up the quick memory test LED at compile time.

o Fixed the module.mak section dealing with assembly source files in a .list.
  The `make depend' process should now properly create .depend entries for
  assembly sources.

o The LED test, quick memory test, and burn-in testing should now pay attention
  to the settings in config.h.  Check config.h for the new LED constants -
  there should be a number beside both QUICK_MEM_LED and BURN_IN_OK_LED.  LED 0
  would be the 0th bit in the LED register.  If you don't care about LED
  functionality, set LED_BASE_ADDR to some untouched memory location.

o Fixed up pkt_stat() a bit, so it will print only 2 decimal places, but more
  accurately.
